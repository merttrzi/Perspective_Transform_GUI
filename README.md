Choose the image, set the paramethers and RUN.

x1: minimum x coordinate in pixels.
x2: maximum x coordinate in pixels.
y1: minimum y coordinate in pixels.
y2: maximum y coordinate in pixels.
threshold: 0-255

You can choose theese four paramethers for the object that you want to apply perspective transform in image. (You can crop the image with theese paramethers and focus the object you choose)

For the image 8mmframe; x1=550, x2=900, y1=550, y2=800, threshold = 200.( If you can set theese paramethers, you get perspective transform applied version of right pattern in the 8mmframe image)
